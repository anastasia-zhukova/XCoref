The 13 - and 15 - inch portables run up to 2.7GHz quad Core i7s (turbo up to 3.7GHz), carry up to 8GB of RAM and have GeForce GT 650M - based graphics 60 percent faster than the previous generation.  Like the new MacBook Air, they tout USB 3.0 ports.  If you're more comfortable with Apple's conventional MacBook Pro design than the new variety, Apple will ask $1, 099 for the base 13 - inch version and $1, 799 for a 15 - inch version, with an upgraded 15 - inch model going for $2, 199.  All of them are shipping today - we're not seeing any mention of an updated 17 - inch version, so it may have been cast aside.", "title": " Apple unveils new MacBook Pro with Ivy Bridge at WWDC.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. 2dayblog.com / 2012 / 06 / 12 / apple - unveils - new - macbook - pro - with - ivy - bridge - at - wwdc /"}
