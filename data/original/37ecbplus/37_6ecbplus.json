Officials say at least 24 people were killed and more than 200 injured by the quake, which struck the western tip of Sumatra island on Tuesday.  One report said six children were killed and 14 trapped under debris when a mosque collapsed in Central Aceh.  Indonesia is located on one of the most seismically active regions on earth.  \"We have recorded 24 people dead and 249 people injured,\" disaster agency spokesman Sutopo Purwo Nugroho told Agence - France Presse (AFP) news agency.  He added that more than 300 buildings have been damaged in the quake.  Power cut  Soldiers and police have been deployed in rescue operations, but have struggled to access some areas where roads were blocked by landslides, officials said.  The Indonesian air force deployed a helicopter and a plane as part of the rescue efforts.  Officials say that the quake was felt for around 15 seconds, from Banda Aceh, the regional capital, to Bener Meriah, one of the worst - hit areas.
