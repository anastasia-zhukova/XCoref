(NYSE : HPQ) has opened up its checkbook once again.  This time, the world's largest tech company by sales announced that it will be buying EYP Mission Critical Facilities Inc.  That company, which provides data center consulting services, will become a division of HP for an undisclosed sum, according to sources.  Is this a move to compete more headily with tech giant IBM Corp. (NYSE : IBM)?  It could certainly be seen that way.  HP's growing presence in providing data center services and contract consulting is the core of IBM's business model these days, now that the latter is out of the hardware business.  EYP provides design, technology planning and support for large data centers - - the kind that runs a large U.S. bank, credit card operation or manufacturing business.  This is right in IBM's territory, and the move should put HP in a more competitive position to challenge IBM as a premier provider of computing services consulting.  Does HP's Mark Hurd want to grow the company he leads into the biggest computing hardware and services manufacturing company the world has ever seen?  In a word, yes.", "title": " Hewlett - Packard makes another acquisition, chases IBM.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. bloggingstocks.com / 2007 / 11 / 14 / hewlett - packard - makes - another - acquisition - chases - ibm /"}
