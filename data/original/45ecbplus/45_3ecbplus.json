Trial is set for June 17 for 26 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson of Fort Coffee, who is accused of fatally shooting Ka'Loni Marie Flynn of Fort Smith, Ark.  A local newspaper reports that Simpson has been held without bond at the LeFlore County Jail since his arrest on June 21.  Flynn's body was found in a car near Spiro on April 9.  Prosecutors allege Simpson shot Flynn after she told him she was pregnant.  Lawyers for Simpson don't want prosecutors to be able to use phone records that allegedly place Simpson in the area of the slaying on grounds that authorities obtained them without a warrant.", "title": " Oklahoma man pleads not guilty in deaths of Arkansas woman and her fetus.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / newsok.com / oklahoma - man - pleads - not - guilty - in - deaths - of - arkansas - woman - and - her - fetus / article / 3742740"}
