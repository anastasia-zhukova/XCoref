The 8900 is the thinnest full-QWERTY BlackBerry smartphone yet. Like its predecessor, the 8320, the 8900 is fully-featured with connectivity options including a built-in GPS and WiFi, something that users of T-Mobile's Unlimited HotSpot Calling service should be excited about. Of course, the Curve 8900 has an impressive list of features of its own. It has been upgraded with a 3.2-megapixel camera with image stabilization and video compatibility. It sports a 512MHz processor and at 480 x 360, its the highest resolution screen available on a BlackBerry. It supports microSD cards up to 16GB (Like the new SanDisk memory cards announced today). Last, the Curve's Quad-band radio, with support for international roaming, should please the jet-setter. Look for it next month at T-Mobile retail stores, authorized dealers, and online.", "title": " T-Mobile USA, Inc. and Research In Motion today announced that T-Mobile will offer the BlackBerry Curve 8900 to customers in February.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
