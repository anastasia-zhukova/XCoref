As expected, it will have integrated Bluetooth and GPS and we now know it will have built-in Wi-Fi as well as support for T-Mobile's Unlimited HotSpot Calling service. Unfortunately, there is no 3G love. There are plenty of other highlights, though, including a 3.2-megapixel camera, a 3.5mm headphone jack, a microSD/SDHC expansion slot (supports up to 16GB cards), and a 512MHz processor. Pricing and an official release date were not released, but customers can sign up for alerts on T-Mobile's Web site.", "title": " On Monday, we reported on rumors that T-Mobile would release the RIM BlackBerry Curve 8900 on February 11, and while the date has not been confirmed, the carrier did go ahead and make the official product announcement on Tuesday.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
