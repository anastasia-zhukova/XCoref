The 8900 is the thinnest BlackBerry ever built (only 13.5 mm), and it's also among the best looking smartphones to come form RIM. Add Wi-Fi, GPS, a 3.2MP autofocus camera and a nice 480 x 360 pixels display to that and you have a really cool handset. The only thing that the Curve 8900 is missing is 3G, but since T-Mobile does n't have a nationwide 3G coverage yet, I guess this is not such a big problem. While waiting for the new Berry to be available, you can enter a T-Mobile contest here, and maybe you 'll win one for free.", "title": " RIM and T-Mobile USA have finally gone official with the BlackBerry Curve 8900, just one day after the smartphone was seen in one of T-Mo's retail stores.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
