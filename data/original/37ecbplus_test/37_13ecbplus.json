At least five people were reportedly injured and 10 houses were damaged in Takengon, the capital of Central Aceh district, said Sutopo Purwo Nugroho of the National Disaster Mitigation Agency.  \"I see many houses were damages and their roofs fell onto some people,\" said Bensu Elianita, a 22 year - old resident in Bukit Sama village in Central Aceh district.  \"Many people were injured but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams.\"  She said many people in the village ran out from their houses in panic and screamed for help.  At least two houses were totally flattened, she said, adding that the quake also caused blackout in the village.
