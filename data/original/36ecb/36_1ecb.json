'' Blackmore, long known as \"the Bishop of Bountiful, '' runs an independent sect of about 400 members in the town of Bountiful. He once ran the Canadian arm of the Utah-based Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, but was ejected in 2003 by that group's leader, Warren Jeffs. Oler is the bishop of Bountiful's FLDS community loyal to Jeffs. Even though many of the town's residents are related or have same last name, followers of the two leaders are splintered and are not allowed to talk with each other. FLDS members practice polygamy in arranged marriages, a tradition tied to the early theology of the Mormon church. Mormons renounced polygamy in 1890 as a condition of Utah's statehood. Last June, Oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at Bountiful despite two earlier legal opinions that said it would be difficult to proceed with criminal charges for polygamy itself. Blackmore openly acknowledges having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said his community abhors sexual abuse of children. Oppal said some legal experts believe polygamy charges will not withstand a constitutional challenge in Canada over the issue of freedom of religion. \"I 've always taken the position that's a valid offense in law, '' Oppal said. \"And if someone says that it's contrary to their religion, let a judge make that decision. '' The FLDS, with an estimated 10,000 members, is headquartered in Colorado City, Ariz., and Hildale, Utah. In 1947, a small group moved just across the border into Lister, British Columbia. The newcomers dubbed the pristine spot at the base of a snowy mountain range Bountiful. Besides an estimated 1,000 Canadians living in Bountiful, the U.S. Embassy estimates there are about 300 Americans there who are loyal to Blackmore and 200 others who follow Jeffs, who is in jail awaiting trial in Arizona on four counts of being an accomplice to sexual conduct with a minor.", "title": " 2 leaders of polygamist group arrested in Canada.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
