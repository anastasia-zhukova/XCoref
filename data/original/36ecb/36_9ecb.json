Winston Blackmore, long known as the Bishop of Bountiful, runs an independent sect of about 400 in Bountiful, British Columbia. Blackmore once ran the Canadian arm of the Utah-based Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, but was ejected from the sect in 2003 by its leader, Warren Jeffs. Last June, British Columbia Attorney General Wally Oppal appointed a special prosecutor to look into allegations of criminal abuse at Bountiful, despite two earlier legal opinions that said it would be difficult to proceed with criminal charges for polygamy itself. Blackmore openly admits to having numerous wives and dozens of children but has said the community abhors sexual abuse of children. According to a court document filed in nearby Creston, Winston Blackmore is facing a charge of practicing polygamy. Officials at the Mormon Hills School in the community, where Blackmore is the superintendent, said he was arrested Wednesday.", "title": " 2 polygamous leaders arrested in Canada.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
