The acquisition is a disruptive one for the low - power server landscape, as SeaMicro has been using Intel chips in its next - generation servers, which offer dramatic reductions in power and space usage.  The crown jewel in the acquisition is SeaMicro \u2019 s networking fabric, which allows hundreds of low - power processors to work together.  The SeaMicro architecture is processor - neutral, meaning it can be quickly adapted to work with AMD \u2019 s technology.  \u201c By acquiring SeaMicro, we are accelerating AMD \u2019 s transformation into an agile, disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position, \u201d said Rory Read, president and CEO, AMD.  \u201c SeaMicro is a pioneer in low - power server technology.  \u201c We are clearly skating to where the puck is going, \u201d Read added.  \u201c This is a great company with innovative IP and great talent. \u201d  The Importance of the Cloud  AMD plans to offer the first AMD Opteron processor - based solutions that combine AMD and SeaMicro technology in the second half of 2012.  The company said it remains firmly committed to its traditional server business, and will continue to invest in research and development.  But AMD executives said the acquisition of SeaMicro will boost the company \u2019 s offerings for cloud computing providers, who are keenly focused on reducing the energy used by their armadas of servers.  \u201c Cloud data centers are the fastest growing segment of the server market, \u201d said Lisa Su, Senior Vice President and General Manager, Global Business Units.  \u201c The cloud has changed the dynamics of the data center and how people think about servers. \u201d  Su said AMD will offer SeaMicro servers with AMD chips to provide continuity for existing customers.  But the primary focus will be on integrating SeaMicro \u2019 s fabric technology with AMD processors in \u201c building blocks \u201d for its OEM customers.  Downsized \u201c Building Block \u201d  The basic building block of the SeaMicro system is a credit card - sized compute block, comprised of a CPU and its chipset, DRAM, and a custom SeaMicro ASIC (application specific integrated circuit).  SeaMicro \u2019 s patented I / O virtualization allows companies to save money by using fewer cables and network interface cards (NICs) to connect to networks and storage.  SeaMicro \u2019 s early systems featured up to 768 Intel Atom cores in a 10U server.  It recently introduced a server powered by 64 Intel Xeon processors, providing a \u201c brawny \u201d offering to supplement the \u201c wimpy \u201d Atom nodes.  One of the benefits of the AMD acquisition is the ability to adapt SeaMicro \u2019 s technology to a broader range of workloads and applications, according the SeaMicro CEO Andrew Feldman.  \u201c SeaMicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers, while increasing compute density and bandwidth, \u201d said Feldman, who will become general manager of AMD \u2019 s newly created Data Center Server Solutions business.  \u201c By becoming a part of AMD, we will have access to new markets, resources, technology, and scale that will provide us with the opportunity to work tightly with our OEM partners as we fundamentally change the server market. \u201d", "title": " AMD to Acquire Server Innovator SeaMicro.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. datacenterknowledge.com / archives / 2012 / 02 / 29 / amd - to - acquire - server - innovator - seamicro /"}
