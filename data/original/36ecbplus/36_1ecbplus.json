The 55 - year older leader of the Fundamentalist Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints was charged with sexual assault of a child after taking a 12 - year old girl and a 15 - year girl as \"spiritual wives.\"  He could be sentenced to up to 119 years in prison.  The jury's decision puts an end to a controversial case that saw Jeffs represent himself against the charges.  Jeffs largely avoided defending himself during the case, only offering a \"I am at peace,\" phrase as his closing statement.  The jury made its decision on the same day that the prosecution played a tape recording of what it alleged was Jeffs sexually assaulting the 11 - year old girl.", "title": " Warren Jeffs Found Guilty on Sexual Assault Charges.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. ibtimes.com / warren - jeffs - found - guilty - sexual - assault - charges - 823855"}
