They just confirmed that they will carry the device though they said nothing about availability and pricing.  They did say that after April 29th business customers will be able to register for the Q10 at this link.  My guess is they will open up preorders for business customers about 2 weeks before normal launch.  Here is how they describe the device :  T - Mobile USA continues to add to its growing 4G LTE smartphone portfolio with the BlackBerry\ufffd Q10.  The BlackBerry Q10 combines BlackBerry's classic QWERTY keyboard and a touch screen with the power of the BlackBerry\ufffd 10 platform that delivers all the speed and connectivity customers demand to help them keep moving.  T - Mobile customers can take advantage of the BlackBerry Q10 smartphone's premium hardware, advanced communications and multimedia features on a blazing - fast nationwide 4G network.  \"With the powerful combination of BlackBerry's new BlackBerry 10 platform, the company's long - standing security features and BlackBerry's best QWERTY keyboard, the BlackBerry Q10 will be another great smartphone option for our business customers,\" said Drew Kelton, executive vice president of business markets at T - Mobile.", "title": " T - Mobile US Confirms They Will Carry the BlackBerry Q10.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. berryreview.com / 2013 / 04 / 24 / t - mobile - us - confirms - they - will - carry - the - blackberry - q10 /"}
