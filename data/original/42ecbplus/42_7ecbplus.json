T - Mobile has announced that it will be carrying the keyboard touting Q10, with pre - registration starting on April 29th.  Pricing and release dates are still TBD, but by signing up for alerts on T - Mobile's website you will be one of the first to know.  If BlackBerry's release of the Z10 to business customers first is any sign, we may very well see the same approach when it comes to releasing the Q10, meaning that normal consumers may have to wait a little longer for their chance to purchase one of the devices.  Although release details are still absent, this e - mail assures us that T - Mobile will in fact be carrying the Q10 in the future.  The Q10 has been previously rumored to be released sometime in May, which seems reasonable given the timing of T - Mobile's announcement today, as well as BlackBerry's announcement of the device making its way to Canada on May 1st.  Official PR text follows below.  T - Mobile today announced that the BlackBerry Q10 will be added to its growing 4G LTE smartphone portfolio.  Beginning April 29th, business customers interested in registering for the BlackBerry Q10 can visit http : / / business. t - mobile.com / blackberry - q10.  Additional details, including availability and pricing, will be shared at a later date.", "title": " T - Mobile Confirms it Will Carry BlackBerry Q10.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. intomobile.com / 2013 / 04 / 24 / tmobile - confirms - blackberry - q10 /"}
