There has been a surge in bets on Capaldi, who plays sweary spin doctor Malcom Tucker in The Thick of It, replacing Matt Smith, according to William Hill.  Joe Crilly, a spokesperson for William Hill, said : 'Peter Capaldi was not even in our list a few days ago but he has been the subject of a lot of betting interest recently and this gamble would suggest that if he does not have the part already, he is almost certainly on the shortlist.'  He now has odds of 2 / 1 to become the 12th Time Lord above Ben Daniels and Rory Kinnear.  Previous favourite Kinnear has slipped down the list after he ruled himself out of the running, claiming he's never seen an episode of Doctor Who.  Capaldi's name may have been linked to the role after Doctor Who creator Steven Moffat said he would not rule out casting an older Doctor.  He said at the recent San Diego Comic - Con : 'We've never not considered an older Doctor.  It is completely on all the lists we make - there are absolutely older Doctors.'", "title": " Peter Capaldi favourite to take over from Matt Smith as Doctor Who.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / metro. co. uk / 2013 / 07 / 31 / peter - capaldi - favourite - to - take - over - from - matt - smith - as - doctor - who - 3905842 /"}
