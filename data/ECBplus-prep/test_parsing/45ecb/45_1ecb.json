In fact, he was convicted in part because defense attorney Mark Geragos offered so many explanations for Peterson's conduct and Laci's disappearance that prosecutors were able to make jurors laugh about the implausibility of them all. In essence, the jury concluded that the circumstances surrounding Laci Peterson's disappearance and death could not reasonably be explained in any other way but that Scott Peterson wanted her dead so he could continue and perhaps expand his secret life with Amber Frey. Peterson was found guilty because jurors believed he had a motive to kill his wife and that Peterson's conduct -- before, during and after Laci Peterson's disappearance -- was too suspicious to be purely coincidental.", "title": " Scott Peterson has been found guilty of first-degree murder, a verdict that means he could be executed if these same jurors vote as the \"conscience of their community '' that he deserves to die for his crimes.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
