Prosecutors and police refused to comment on the reports, but have scheduled a news conference in Vancouver to discuss legal action involving two people from the religious community in Bountiful, British Columbia. Blackmore, 52, was not available for comment. The FLDS, an offshoot of the mainstream Mormon Church, also has communities in the United States, where its leader and self-proclaimed prophet, Warren Jeffs, has been convicted on charges of forcing underage women to marry older men. British Columbia Attorney General Wally Oppal appointed a special prosecutor in June to investigate laying charges against the FLDS, which is believed to have about 700 members living in southeastern British Columbia. Oppal had to use a special prosecutor because the province's regular prosecution service had been openly reluctant to press polygamy charges on the grounds that the law might be ruled unconstitutional as a violation of religious rights. Blackmore has challenged authorities in the past to file charges against him, and has denied any criminal wrongdoing within the community.", "title": " Canadian authorities filed charges on Wednesday against the leader of a group that openly practices polygamy in British Columbia and has links to U.S. polygamist communities, local media reported.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
