A powerful 6. 1 magnitude earthquake hit Indonesia's northwestern Aceh province on the island of Sumatra early Tuesday.  Dozens have been reported injured.  The epicenter of the quake was roughly 55 kilometers from the town of Bireuen, a regency of the larger Aceh province, according to data from the US Geological Survey.  It took place at 7 : 37 AM local time.  Although it's unknown how many were injured, Sky News estimates\"at least 50 people,\" and numerous buildings have collapsed as an effect of the powerful tremor.  The quake appears to have shaken the provincial capital of Banda Aceh, which is located at the northern tip of the Sumatran land mass.

Aceh was hit extremely hard by the massive Boxing Day earthquake and tsunami in 2004, killing 170, 000 people in Sumatra alone - with 35, 000 bodies never recovered.
