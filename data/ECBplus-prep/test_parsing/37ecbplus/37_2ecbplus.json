According to the US Geological Survey, the quake hit at a depth of 10 kilometers (6 miles) in the Northern Province of Aceh.  The epicenter was situated 55 kilometers (34 miles) west of the town of Bireun on the western tip of Sumatra Island.  Eyewitnesses and local residents say many homes and properties have collapsed or been damaged.  \"I see many houses were damaged and their roofs fell onto some people,\" said Bensu Elianita, a 22 year - old resident in Bukit Sama village in Central Aceh district, adding, \"Many people were injured but it is difficult to evacuate them due to traffic jams.\"  On April 20, a 6. 4 - magnitude earthquake jolted Indonesia's Maluku, but caused no casualties or material damage.  On April 6, an earthquake measuring 7. 2 on the Richter scale struck eastern Indonesia's mountainous West Papua province.  Indonesia is vulnerable to earthquakes since it is located on the Pacific Ring of Fire, a region known for its seismic and volcanic activity caused by friction between shifting tectonic plates.  Last year, a 6. 4 - magnitude quake rocked the west coast of Sumatra Island, killing at least one person.  An 8. 7 - magnitude earthquake also hit off the city of Banda Aceh in Sumatra Island in May 2012, triggering regional tsunami alerts.  A strong quake off the shores of Indonesia triggered a tsunami that killed 230, 000 people in 13 countries around the Indian Ocean in 2004.", "title": " 6. 1 - magnitude quake strikes Indonesia's Aceh province.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. presstv.com / detail / 2013 / 07 / 02 / 311886 / strong - earthquake - hits - indonesia /"}
