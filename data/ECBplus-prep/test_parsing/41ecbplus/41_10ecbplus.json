A government official initially reported deaths, but an American activist who spoke to aid workers at the camp later said there were no casualties.  The violence in and near the Yida refugee camp, located 10 miles south of the border, came one day after bombings were reported in another region of South Sudan, an attack that provoked strong condemnation from the U.S. State Department.  The president of South Sudan, which became the world's newest country only four months ago, said he fears the Khartoum - based government intends to invade the south soon.  \"Whatever allegations Khartoum labels against the Republic of South Sudan are baseless, but intended to justify his pending invasion of the south,\" President Salva Kiir said.  He later added : \"We are committed to peaceful resolutions to any conflict but we will never allow our sovereignty to be violated by anybody.\"  There was no immediate comment from the Sudanese government in Khartoum on Thursday.  The violence is especially troubling given the history between the two sides : The black African tribes of South Sudan and the mainly Arab north battled two civil wars over more than five decades, and some 2 million died in the latest war, from 1983 - 2005.  A peace deal ended the war and South Sudan became its own country in July after a successful independence referendum.  But there have been lingering disputes over border demarcation and oil - sharing revenues.  Ryan Boyette, a former aid worker who lives in Sudan who is now leading a team of 15 citizen journalists, said he talked to five aid workers in the Yida camp, all of whom said that four bombs were dropped but that they caused no casualties.", "title": " South Sudan warns of war after Sudan bombs refugee camp.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / usatoday30. usatoday.com / news / world / story / 2011 - 11 - 10 / sudan - violence / 51150434 / 1"}
