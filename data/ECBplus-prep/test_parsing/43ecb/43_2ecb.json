For now, Arthur said AMD's takeover deal, which is expected to close in the fourth quarter, effectively offers his one-year price target of $ 21 now. That price target was set prior to the takeover bid and factored in ATI's gross margin leverage, capital expenditure strength, a competitive product lineup and the launch of Microsoft (nasdaq : MSFT - news - people) Windows' new operating system, Vista, which would be a \"net positive '' for graphics-chips vendors. Without a competitive bid to drive shares higher, ATI is unlikely to outperform, warranting a \"sector perform '' rating in the analyst's view. Arthur said a competitive bid is possible but the two most-likely bidders, Intel (nasdaq : INTC - news - people) and Nvdidia, face prohibitive anti-trust challenges. Combined, ATI and Intel would have 68 % overall market share in PC graphics, while an ATI-Nvidia partnership would effectively capture 100 % of the discrete graphics market. Other counteroffers could be made by Texas Instruments (nyse : TXN - news - people) and Broadcom (nasdaq : BRCM - news - people), which, according to Arthur, would n't so much face anti-trust challenges as they would compatibility challenges.", "title": " RBC Capital Markets downgraded ATI Technologies to \"sector perform '' from \"outperform '' after Advanced Micro Devices announced its intention to buy the Canadian graphics chip-maker for $ 5.4 billion on Monday.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
