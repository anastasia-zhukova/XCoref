Through the acquisition of SeaMicro, AMD will be accelerating its strategy to deliver disruptive server technology to its OEM customers serving cloud - centric data centers.  With SeaMicro \u2019 s fabric technology and system - level design capabilities, AMD will be uniquely positioned to offer industry - leading server building blocks tuned for the fastest - growing workloads such as dynamic web content, social networking, search and video.  AMD \u2019 s server technology combined with SeaMicro technology provides customers with a range of processor choices and platforms that can help significantly reduce data center complexity, cost and energy consumption while improving performance.  AMD plans to offer the first AMD Opteron\u2122 processor - based solutions that combine AMD and SeaMicro technology in the second half of 2012.  The company remains firmly committed to its traditional server business, and will continue to focus and invest in this area.  \u201c By acquiring SeaMicro, we are accelerating AMD \u2019 s transformation into an agile, disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position, \u201d said Rory Read, president and CEO, AMD.  \u201c SeaMicro is a pioneer in low - power server technology.  The unmatched combination of AMD \u2019 s processing capabilities, SeaMicro \u2019 s system and fabric technology, and our ambidextrous technology approach uniquely positions AMD with a compelling, differentiated position to attack the fastest growing segment of the server market. \u201d  SeaMicro technologies offer substantial advantages in large data center and cloud environments.  Cloud data centers are projected to be the fastest growing segment of the server market through 2015, according to IDC1.  Current systems featuring SeaMicro technology typically use one quarter the power and take one sixth the space of traditional servers with the same compute performance, yet deliver up to 12 times the bandwidth per core2.  Foremost among SeaMicro \u2019 s innovations is their supercompute fabric, which connects thousands of processor cores, memory, storage and input / output traffic.  SeaMicro \u2019 s fabric supports multiple processor instruction sets.  SeaMicro solutions are currently deployed in multiple sites across the world.  AMD will continue to support all current SeaMicro customers while accelerating plans to deliver new platforms that combine AMD and SeaMicro technology and enable AMD \u2019 s OEM partners to bring differentiated solutions to market.  \u201c Cloud computing has brought a sea change to the data center - - dramatically altering the economics of compute by changing the workload and optimal characteristics of a server, \u201d said Andrew Feldman, SeaMicro CEO, who will become general manager of AMD \u2019 s newly created Data Center Server Solutions business.  \u201c SeaMicro was founded to dramatically reduce the power consumed by servers, while increasing compute density and bandwidth.  By becoming a part of AMD, we will have access to new markets, resources, technology, and scale that will provide us with the opportunity to work tightly with our OEM partners as we fundamentally change the server market. \u201d  The acquisition does not change AMD \u2019 s 2012 financial guidance and the transaction is expected to be accretive to earnings after 2012.  AMD will fund the cash portion of the acquisition with existing cash reserves.  AMD Conference Call  AMD will hold a conference call for the financial community at 4 : 45 p. m. EST today to discuss today \u2019 s announcement.  AMD will provide a real - time audio broadcast of the teleconference on the Investor Relations page of its Web site at www. AMD.com.  The webcast will be available for 10 days after the conference call.", "title": " AMD to Acquire SeaMicro : Accelerates Disruptive Server Strategy.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. amd.com / us / press - releases / Pages / amd - confidential - 2012feb29. aspx"}
