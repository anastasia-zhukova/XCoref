The deal cost AMD $334 million ($281M in cash), a fairly sizable chunk of change when you consider that its yearly profits are usually around the $400 million mark.  If you haven \u2019 t heard of SeaMicro before, they \u2019 re essentially a Silicon Valley startup built around a technology called Freedom Fabric, an ASIC (Application - Specific Integrated Circuit) that allows a computer to be scaled down to a motherboard the size of a deck of playing cards.  These tiny computers (each one containing an Atom or Xeon CPU, some DRAM, and the Freedom Fabric ASIC) are then stacked together to form very - high - density servers (pictured above).  These server bricks are just 10U in size, contain up to 768 CPUs, and include four gigabit Ethernet switches and a load balancer.  To achieve the same kind of processing power with conventional rackmount servers you would need two full racks (84U!) of dual - socket quad - core servers and network gear.  The SeaMicro server bricks use a quarter of the power, too, because the custom CPU - DRAM - ASICs contain absolutely no hardware cruft that leeches power.  In short, with energy prices increasing, data center real estate as costly as ever, and the web showing no signs of slowing down, SeaMicro servers are really rather desirable.  More than miniaturization, though, Freedom Fabric is also compatible with multiple instruction sets and allows for complete hardware virtualization ; both very desirable properties in this age of cloud computing.  But why did AMD buy SeaMicro?  As it stands, SeaMicro has a tight partnership with Intel, and every SeaMicro server uses Intel chips.  According to AMD, SeaMicro will sell Intel - based servers \u201c for the foreseeable future, \u201d but an Opteron - based solution should arrive by the end of the year.  In all likelihood, AMD probably sees SeaMicro as an excellent way of bolstering its presence in the incredibly lucrative (and rapidly expanding) server market.  With SeaMicro, AMD can deal directly with companies looking for servers, cutting out the (very profitable) HP, Dell, or IBM middle man.  The server space is one area that AMD still seems to be able compete with Intel and with Freedom Fabric AMD might once again become a compelling choice.", "title": " AMD buys SeaMicro, starts selling Intel - based servers.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. extremetech.com / computing / 120601 - amd - buys - seamicro - starts - selling - intel - based - servers"}
