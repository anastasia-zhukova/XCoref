SeaMicro chief executive Andrew Feldman will become general manager of a newly formed AMD business unit called Data Center Server Solutions.  \"SeaMicro's leading - edge fabric technology together with AMD Opteron processors point the way to a compelling roadmap for the cloud data center market,\" said Lisa Su, senior vice president and general manager of AMD's Global Business Units, in a discussion with reporters at the chip maker's Sunnyvale, Calif. headquarters ahead of the announcement.  The company will continue to honor SeaMicro's existing relationships with its own partners, Su said, and will sell SeaMicro - branded servers, which currently use server chips made by AMD archrival Intel.  Feldman, who also spoke with media Wednesday, said SeaMicro's technology was \"processor - agnostic,\" so incorporating AMD's Opteron processors and even non - x86 instruction sets and architectures in future products would be easy to do.  AMD representatives said they believed SeaMicro's unique supercompute fabric was a major innovation in data center technology, characterizing the platform as a \"new server building block\"which would increasingly make its way into the growing cloud infrastructure space.  \"When you're talking about the ability to tie together large amounts of processor cores, hundreds and even thousands, within a server system, there aren't a lot of choices out there [in terms of competitors], particularly if you want to bring Ethernet over it and disk traffic over it, there's just us,\" said Feldman, describing his company's technology.  \"Nobody else can move both Ethernet and disk traffic, because they have very different requirements,\" he added.  Feldman said SeaMicro's suitors were numerous in the days leading up to the AMD acquisition and included more than just semiconductor companies.  In recent months, Intel and other companies had spoken highly of the innovative startup.  \"We were fortunate that when we began speaking with AMD, they had far and away the most sophisticated view on fabrics,\" he said.  \"They had already done extensive work on what a next - generation fabric could look like.  They were kindred spirits and when you find that, you can move very quickly.  And they really moved with dazzling speed.\"  AMD president and chief executive Rory Read also addressed the deal in a statement, saying that the SeaMicro acquisition would accelerate \"AMD's transformation into an agile, disruptive innovator capable of staking a data center leadership position.\"", "title": " AMD to Acquire Microserver Startup SeaMicro for $334 Million.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. pcmag.com / article2 / 0, 2817, 2401008, 00. asp"}
