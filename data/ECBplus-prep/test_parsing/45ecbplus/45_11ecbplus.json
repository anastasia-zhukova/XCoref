The jury deliberated almost seven hours Thursday before convicting 27 - year - old Christopher Kenyon Simpson in the death of 20 - year - old Ka'loni Flynn of Fort Smith, Ark.  The Southwest Times Record reports that the jury recommended the maximum sentence of life in prison without parole.  Formal sentencing is set for 11 a. m. on Nov. 8.  Prosecutors allege that Simpson shot Flynn twice in the head because he did not want another child to support.  A DNA expert testified that Simpson fathered the fetus.  Simpson's attorney, Warren Gotcher, argued that no witnesses could place Simpson at the shooting scene and that his client was innocent.", "title": " Jury Convicts Spiro Man In Shooting Death Of Pregnant Girlfriend.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": " http : / / www. kctv5.com / story / 23548345 / jury - convicts - spiro - man - in - arkansas - womans - death"}
