H-P announced Tuesday that it will buy the outsourcing services company for $ 13.9 billion. The deal will be bad \"for anyone that does n't have H-P or IBM (IBM Quote - Cramer on IBM - Stock Picks) on their business card, '' said IDC analyst Bob Welch. Even IBM, the leader in the global services and outsourcing business, will ultimately feel the pressure. Gartner puts the worldwide market for IT services in 2007 at $ 748 billion. With $ 54 billion in services revenue, IBM had 7.2 % of the market. At $ 22 billion, EDS had 3 %, while H-P had 2.3 %. And the merger could throw a wrench into EDS's Agility Alliance, a group of vendors that regularly coordinate to supply hardware, networking, software and services to EDS's outsourcing clients. The partnership has been very effective for EDS and its partners, Welch said.", "title": " Big Blue to Meet Its Match in HP-EDS.", "title_page": null, "title_rss": null, "url": null}
